            Threading is a non-surgical cosmetic procedure used to lift and
            tighten the skin by inserting threads made of absorbable material
            (typically PDO—polydioxanone) beneath the skin. The threads are
            strategically placed to stimulate collagen production, lift sagging
            skin, and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s
            also known as a minimally invasive skin rejuvenation treatment.

          <h3>How Threading Works</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Thread Insertion:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Special threads are inserted into the dermal layer of the skin
                  using a fine needle. The threads are placed in a specific
                  pattern, depending on the treatment area and the desired
                  results (e.g., jawline, cheeks, or neck).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Stimulation of Collagen:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The insertion of threads creates micro-injuries in the skin,
                  stimulating the body’s natural healing response. This process
                  boosts collagen and elastin production, which helps firm and
                  tighten the skin over time.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Lifting Effect:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The threads themselves have a lifting effect immediately upon
                  insertion. Over time, as the threads dissolve (typically
                  within 6–12 months), they continue to stimulate collagen
                  production, leading to long-lasting, natural-looking results.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Gradual Improvement:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Results are not immediate but develop over several weeks as
                  collagen production increases, leading to firmer, smoother,
                  and more youthful-looking skin.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Benefits of Threading:</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Non-Surgical Lift:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Threading provides a non-invasive alternative to facelifts,
                  offering a lift and tightening effect without the need for
                  incisions, stitches, or long recovery times.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Immediate Lifting Effect:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Once the threads are inserted, there’s an immediate
                  improvement in skin texture and appearance, as they lift the
                  skin and provide a more youthful, refreshed look.
                </li>
                <li>Helps diminish vascular lesions.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Stimulates Collagen Production:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Over time, the threads promote natural collagen production,
                  which helps maintain skin structure and elasticity, leading to
                  long-term skin rejuvenation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              No Scarring:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Unlike traditional surgical facelifts, threading does not
                  leave any scars because the threads are inserted through tiny
                  entry points (usually small punctures) that heal quickly.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimal Downtime:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Recovery time is relatively quick, with most people
                  experiencing only mild swelling or bruising for a few days
                  after treatment. You can typically return to your daily
                  activities soon after the procedure.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Safe and Absorbable Threads:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The threads used in the procedure are made from materials
                  (like PDO, PLLA) that are naturally absorbed by the body over
                  time, reducing the risk of long-term complications.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Customizable and Precise:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The procedure is highly customizable and can be used to target
                  specific areas of concern, such as the jawline, cheeks,
                  eyebrows, or neck, for a tailored lifting effect.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Why Threading is Good</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Minimally Invasive:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Threading offers a less invasive way to achieve facial lifting
                  and rejuvenation compared to surgery, with no need for cuts or
                  stitches.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural-Looking Results:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The gradual collagen stimulation process results in more
                  natural, subtle improvements over time, without the “pulled”
                  or overly-tightened look.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-Lasting Effects:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Though the threads dissolve over time (usually within 6–12
                  months), the results last much longer, as the collagen
                  generated continues to support the skin for up to 1–2 years.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Quick Treatment:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The procedure is typically done in under an hour, depending on
                  the areas being treated. It’s an excellent option for those
                  who want noticeable results without the lengthy downtime of
                  traditional facelifts.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Versatile:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Threading can be used to treat a variety of concerns,
                  including sagging skin, jowls, nasolabial folds, crow’s feet,
                  and even eyebrow lifting.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Types of Threads Used in Threading:</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              PDO (Polydioxanone) Threads:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  These are the most commonly used threads in facial threading.
                  PDO threads are absorbable and stimulate collagen production
                  over time, providing gradual and natural skin tightening.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              PLLA (Poly-L-Lactic Acid) Threads:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  These threads are also absorbable and help stimulate collagen
                  production, but they are often used for longer-lasting results
                  compared to PDO threads.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              PCL (Polycaprolactone) Threads:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  PCL threads last longer than PDO and PLLA threads and are
                  typically used for more significant skin lifting in areas with
                  more volume loss.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Considerations</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Temporary Results:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  While the effects of threading can last up to 1–2 years, the
                  threads eventually dissolve, so periodic treatments are
                  required for continued results.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mild Side Effects:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Some swelling, bruising, or tenderness may occur in the
                  treated areas after the procedure, but these side effects
                  usually resolve within a few days to a week.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Not for Everyone:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Threading may not be suitable for individuals with certain
                  skin conditions or those with severe skin sagging. A
                  consultation is necessary to determine if it's the right
                  treatment.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Why People Choose Threading:</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              No Need for Surgery:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Many people prefer threading over traditional facelifts
                  because it’s non-invasive and doesn’t require lengthy recovery
                  or significant downtime.
                </li>
              </ul>

                  quality by stimulating collagen production.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
