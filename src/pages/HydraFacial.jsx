            HydraFacial is a non-invasive, multi-step skin treatment that uses a
            patented device to cleanse, exfoliate, extract impurities, and
            hydrate the skin. It's a popular facial procedure known for its
            ability to improve skin texture, tone, and overall health without
            downtime. The treatment is suitable for most skin types and can be
            customized to address specific concerns.

          <h3>How HydraFacial Works</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Cleansing and Exfoliation:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Removes dead skin cells and surface impurities to reveal a
                  fresh layer of skin.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Acid Peel:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  A gentle blend of glycolic and salicylic acids loosens debris
                  in the pores without irritation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Extraction:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The device uses a vacuum-like tip to painlessly extract
                  blackheads, whiteheads, and other impurities from the pores.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Hydration:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Delivers a customized blend of serums, including antioxidants,
                  peptides, and hyaluronic acid, to nourish and hydrate the
                  skin.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Protection:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Ends with a layer of protective serums to lock in moisture and
                  provide a radiant glow.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Benefits of HydraFacial</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Deep Cleansing and Exfoliation:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Effectively removes dead skin cells, dirt, and oil that can
                  clog pores and dull the complexion.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Hydration and Nourishment:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Infuses the skin with moisture and essential nutrients,
                  leaving it plump and dewy.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Improves Skin Texture and Tone:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Reduces the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and
                  hyperpigmentation for a smoother, more even complexion.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimizes Pores:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Helps unclog and shrink the appearance of pores, leaving the
                  skin refined.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Gentle and Non-Irritating:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Unlike some chemical peels or abrasive treatments, HydraFacial
                  is gentle enough for sensitive skin and requires no downtime.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <li>
                  Can be tailored to address specific skin concerns, such as
                  acne, dullness, or aging signs.
                </li>
