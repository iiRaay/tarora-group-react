            Dermaplaning is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure that involves
            gently exfoliating the skin's surface using a sterile,
            surgical-grade blade. The process removes dead skin cells and fine
            vellus hair (commonly referred to as "peach fuzz"), leaving the skin
            smoother and brighter. It is performed by a trained professional.

          <h3>How Dermaplaning Works</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Exfoliation:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The blade is used to gently scrape off the outermost layer of
                  dead skin cells.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Hair Removal:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Simultaneously removes fine facial hair that can trap dirt,
                  oil, and makeup.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Skin Smoothing:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Enhances the skin's texture by creating a silky-smooth
                  surface.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h3>Benefits of Dermaplaning</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">

              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Creates a smooth canvas for makeup application, allowing
                  foundation and other products to glide on seamlessly.
                </li>
                <li>Leaves the skin feeling soft and velvety.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  By removing dull, dead skin cells, the skin looks instantly
                  brighter and more radiant.
                </li>
                <li>Enhances the natural glow of the skin.</li>

                <li>
                  Clears away surface barriers (dead skin and hair), enabling
                  skincare products to penetrate more effectively.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-Invasive and Painless:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Requires no downtime and is painless when performed correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Suitable for people with sensitive skin or those who cannot
                  tolerate chemical exfoliants.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduces Appearance of Fine Lines:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Improves the look of fine lines and superficial wrinkles by
                  exfoliating the outer layer of the skin.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Safe for Most Skin Types:

              Non-Aggressive:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Unlike chemical peels or laser treatments, dermaplaning is

              No Harsh Chemicals:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Ideal for those seeking a natural approach to exfoliation or
                  who have allergies to certain skincare products.

              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>

              Temporary Results:

                <li>
                  The effects of dermaplaning typically last 3â€“4 weeks as the
                  skin naturally regenerates.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Not Ideal for Everyone:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Individuals with active acne or inflamed skin should book a
                  consult before booking a treatment to avoid aggravating
                  current skin conditions.
