            BB Glow is a semi-permanent facial treatment that involves
            microneedling a tinted serum into the skin to create a glowing, even
            complexion. The serum contains nourishing ingredients like vitamins,
            antioxidants, peptides, and a natural pigment that gives the skin a
            brightened, dewy appearance. The treatment is popular for its
            ability to reduce the appearance of imperfections and provide a
            subtle "foundation-like" effect without the need for makeup.

          <h3>How BB Glow Works</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Cleansing and Exfoliation:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The skin is thoroughly cleaned and exfoliated to remove dead
                  skin cells and prepare it for treatment.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Microneedling Application:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  A microneedling device is used to infuse the tinted BB Glow
                  serum into the epidermis (outer layer of the skin).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Nourishment and Pigmentation:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The serum delivers active ingredients that hydrate and nourish
                  the skin while the pigment evens out skin tone.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Collagen Stimulation:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The microneedling process stimulates collagen production,
                  improving skin texture and elasticity over time.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Benefits of BB Glow</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Evens Out Skin Tone:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation, redness, and
                  uneven skin tone, leaving the skin looking brighter and more
                  uniform.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimizes Imperfections:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Smoothens the appearance of fine lines, pores, and mild acne
                  scars.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Provides a Natural Glow:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Leaves the skin with a radiant, dewy finish, mimicking the
                  effect of lightweight makeup or BB cream.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Hydrates and Nourishes:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The serums used in BB Glow treatments contain hyaluronic acid,
                  vitamins, and antioxidants that deeply hydrate the skin.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Semi-Permanent Effect:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Results last 4â€“6 months with proper skincare, reducing the
                  need for daily foundation application.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-Invasive:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The procedure is gentle and requires minimal downtime compared
                  to more invasive skin treatments.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Customizable Shades:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The pigment in the BB Glow serum can be adjusted to suit
                  different skin tones.

          <h3>Considerations</h3>
          <ol className="part-a">
            <li>
              Temporary Results:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  The treatment is semi-permanent and may require maintenance
                  sessions to prolong the effect.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Not a Replacement for Skincare:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  While BB Glow improves the skin's appearance, it doesn't treat
                  underlying skin conditions like acne or deep pigmentation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mild Side Effects:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Redness or slight irritation may occur immediately after the
                  procedure but typically subsides within a day or two.
                </li>

              Skin Type Limitations:
              <ul className="inner-a">
                <li>
                  Individuals with active acne, sensitive skin, or certain skin
